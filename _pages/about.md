I am a PhD student (Nov.2019-) at the [Empirical Inference Department, Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, Tübingen, Germany](https://ei.is.mpg.de/), supervised by [Krikamol Muandet](https://krikamol.org) and [Bernhard Schölkopf](https://is.mpg.de/~bs). I will defend my PhD in July 2024, and start my postdoc position in October 2025 at the [Statistical Machine Learning Group at ETH Zürich](https://sml.inf.ethz.ch/) with [Fanny Yang](https://sml.inf.ethz.ch/group/fannyy/). From September to December 2024, I will also be visiting the [Simons Institute at UC Berkeley](https://simons.berkeley.edu/homepage) for the [Modern Paradigms in Generalization](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/modern-paradigms-generalization) programme. 

I am learning about causality (with a focus on the measure-theoretic axiomatisation thereof) and statistical learning theory.
