I will start as a post-doctoral researcher in October 2024 at the [Statistical Machine Learning](https://sml.inf.ethz.ch/) group at ETH Zürich with [Fanny Yang](https://sml.inf.ethz.ch/group/fannyy/). From September to December 2024, I will also be visiting the [Simons Institute](https://simons.berkeley.edu/homepage) at UC Berkeley for the [Modern Paradigms in Generalization](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/modern-paradigms-generalization) programme. 

Previously, I received my PhD at the [Empirical Inference Department](https://ei.is.mpg.de/), Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, Tuebingen, Germany, supervised by [Krikamol Muandet](https://krikamol.org) and [Bernhard Schölkopf](https://is.mpg.de/~bs). 

I am learning about causality (with a focus on the [measure-theoretic axiomatisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17139) thereof) and statistical learning theory.
