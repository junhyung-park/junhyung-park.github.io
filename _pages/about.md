I am a PhD student (Nov.2019-) at the [Empirical Inference Department, Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, Tübingen, Germany](https://ei.is.mpg.de/), supervised by [Krikamol Muandet](https://krikamol.org) and [Bernhard Schölkopf](https://is.mpg.de/~bs). 

I am learning about causality and statistical learning theory, with a current focus on a measure-theoretic axiomatisation of causality and deep learning theory.
